 I am a final-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) advised by [Prof. Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/). I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering (2021) from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). My research interests revolve around LLM reasoning, data-centric pre-training, and connecting language models with graph-structured knowledge. 
 
I’m currently an intern at [Zhipu AI](https://z.ai/chat), where I work on the [GLM](https://huggingface.co/zai-org) pre-training data pipeline, focusing on the curation, synthesis, and evaluation of pre-training data, especially in STEM domains. I genuinely enjoy the humble work of helping language models build the boundaries of their world.

 Before that, I worked at [ByteDance Seed](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/) on multi-agent LLM systems, and spent some time at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/) working on graph intelligence for financial application.
